# Chapter-tracker

This is a chrome extension to track your progress in an anime/manga/tv show/...

By the way it is not deployed yet if you want to use it [look here](#install-it) 

Feel free to contribute to it, it is still in development and it is my first extension so I have trouble for some things ;).

## The extension

As you can see, you track episodes/scans number

When adding anything, you also add a link so you can click the name and arrive directly on the page

## Install it

- Clone the project or download a release anywhere on your computer
- Then on google chrome (or any chromium based browser) go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developper mode
- Click on `Load unpacked`
- Select the folder in which the project is
- Then you can find it and use it in your extensions

## To do

- [ ] Optimize algorithm that update links based on episode number
- [ ] Automaticly update episode counts based on user navigation
- [ ] Find a new name :(
- [ ] Make an icon/logo
- [ ] Find ideas to make it better :)
- [ ] Have a global server and have accounts to share lists
